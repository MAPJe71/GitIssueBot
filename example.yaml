  It looks like there is some information missing from your ticket that will be needed
  in order to diagnose and fix the problem at hand. Please take a look at the [Contribution
  Guidelines](https://github.com/myuser/myrepository/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), which 
  will tell you **exactly** what your ticket has to contain in order to be processable.


  I''m marking this one now as needing some more information. Please understand that
  if you do not provide that information within the next two weeks (until {until})
  I''ll close this ticket so it doesn''t clutter the bug tracker.
